__**Stalkyboi**__

Stalkyboi is a bot to help you and your friends predict your turnip prices. He will track your prices and provide analysis for the week so you can work out whose island to go to get sum bells.

__**I'm a first time buyer!**__
By default, first time mode is disabled. But if you are a first time buyer, you can toggle it on and off by typing `stalk first time (true|false)`


__**Inputting prices**__

`stalk {your_price}` - (For UK timezone only currently - sorry!) At any point in the day, to input your current buy (on Sundays) or sell price
`stalk sunday {price}` or `stalk buy {price}` can be used to input your buy price
`stalk (monday|tuesday|...) (am|pm) ${price}` can be used to input your prices for the week, for example *stalk monday am 105*

__**Feedback**__
Stalky is a work in progress, if he's a bit shit then give him your feedback. He won't take it on board.
